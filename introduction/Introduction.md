# Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the basic structure for web content by using a system of tags and elements. HTML allows developers to organize text, embed images, create links, and build interactive forms, making it the foundation of every website on the internet.

With HTML, you can:

- Structure web documents with headings, paragraphs, lists, and more.
- Embed multimedia elements like images, audio, and video.
- Link to other web pages and resources.
- Create forms for user input.

Learning HTML is the first step towards becoming a web developer and understanding how the web works.
